# haydn_op20_harm
Manually-annotated corpus of functional harmonic analysis in **harm syntax

## Description
This corpus is a set of functional harmonic analysis annotations for the Op.20 string quartets from Joseph Haydn, commonly known as the ["Sun" quartets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_Quartets,_Op._20_(Haydn)).

### Format
The harmonic annotations are included as **harm spines in the humdrum format. The humdrum files were originally taken from the KernScores website, and the same algorithm for automatic harmonic analysis is used, which is based in the Melisma Music Analyzer and the Humdrum-Extra tools.

### Additions
The original corpus from the KernScores websites is missing five works from this Op.20, these files have been included in this repository
